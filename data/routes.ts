      "Embark on an unforgettable journey through Prague, a city that seems to have stepped right out of a fairy tale. This route will guide you through its most picturesque corners, starting with the majestic Charles Bridge, where every statue holds its own legend, and the views of Prague Castle are simply breathtaking. You'll walk along cobblestone streets that remember centuries of history, immersing yourself in the atmosphere of old Europe. Prague Castle, towering over the city, offers not only stunning architectural ensembles but also panoramic views that will serve as a perfect backdrop for your photographs. Don't miss the opportunity to visit Old Town Square with its famous Astronomical Clock, which comes alive every hour, gathering crowds of spectators. Stroll through the Jewish Quarter (Josefov), where every stone breathes history and culture. Discover Wenceslas Square, the pulsating center of modern Prague, and admire the unique architecture of the Dancing House. Conclude your day at Petřín Lookout Tower, offering an incredible view of the entire city, or at the John Lennon Wall, a symbol of peace and freedom. This route is ideal for history buffs, architecture enthusiasts, and photographers looking to fully immerse themselves in the magic of Prague. Be sure to try traditional Czech trdelník and beer in one of the cozy local cafes to end your day with a true taste of Prague. Comfortable shoes are a must, as the route involves a lot of walking on cobblestones. The best time to visit is spring or early autumn, when the weather is mild and tourist crowds are not as overwhelming. Prepare to be captivated by every turn, as each corner reveals a new picturesque scene worthy of your lens, promising an enriching and memorable experience.",

      "Looking for a tour in French? Want stories, anecdotes, and the fates of Berliners? My tours are for you! The guided tours I offer will allow you to discover Berlin quietly, in a small group, from a historical, but also political, social and economic point of view. Author of a tour guide and a book on German memorial politics, I know the capital in the smallest details, where I have lived since 1994. Thanks to my journalistic activities and meetings with many witnesses of history since 1945, I was able to enrich my explanations about the soul of this city, which is difficult to understand.\n\nOur route begins at the majestic Reichstag building, a symbol of German democracy and the country's turbulent history. We will talk about its construction in 1894, the mysterious fire of 1933, which Hitler used to strengthen his power, and the modern reconstruction by Sir Norman Foster with his famous glass dome, symbolizing the transparency of modern German politics. You will learn little-known facts about the storming of the Reichstag by Soviet troops in 1945 and how the building ended up in the western sector, but in close proximity to the Berlin Wall.\n\nNext, we will go to the Brandenburg Gate - the only surviving city gate of Berlin, built in 1791 on the model of the Athenian Acropolis. I will tell you how this monument witnessed key moments in German history: from the triumphal procession of Napoleonic troops and Nazi parades to the division of the city by the wall and the subsequent reunification of Germany. It is here, at the Brandenburg Gate, that you will feel how history literally comes to life under your feet.\n\nSpecial attention in our route is paid to the Berlin Wall - the most known symbol of the Cold War. We will visit the preserved fragments of the wall and the memorial, where I will share with you not only the official history of the division of the city, but also the personal stories of Berliners: tragic escape attempts, divided families and secret meetings at the wall. You will learn about everyday life in a divided city, about the control system in East Berlin and how the fall of the wall in 1989 became one of the most emotional moments in European history of the 20th century.\n\nThe final point of our route will be the Holocaust Memorial - an impressive monument consisting of 2,711 concrete steles of various heights. I will tell you about the history of the creation of this controversial memorial, about the debates that accompanied its construction, and about how modern Germany is working to preserve the memory of the tragic pages of its history. We will discuss the symbolism of Peter Eisenman's architectural solution and how this memorial fits into the general concept of the culture of memory in modern Berlin.\n\nThroughout the route, I will share with you not only historical facts, but also personal observations about the transformation of the city after the fall of the wall, about the contrasts between the eastern and western parts of Berlin, which are still noticeable to the attentive eye, about modern challenges and how the city has turned into one of the most dynamic cultural centers of Europe. This comprehensive tour is designed to give you a profound understanding of Berlin's past and present, making your visit truly unforgettable. From the solemnity of historical sites to the vibrancy of modern life, you'll experience the full spectrum of what makes Berlin unique. Prepare to be captivated by the stories and transformations of this incredible city.",
